# Changelog

## v0.2.1

Hardening release inspired by aweswitch: a version-drift fix, a more robust update check, a clean error boundary for a corrupt bookmark store, and internal deduplication.

### Highlights

- Fix: `__version__` is now read from installed package metadata instead of a hardcoded value. The published 0.2.0 was reporting 0.1.9, producing a permanent, un-clearable "update available" nag.
- Fix: version comparison now parses pre-release and post-release versions (e.g. `0.2.0rc1`, `1.0.0.post1`) instead of silently treating them as `(0,)`.
- Fix: a corrupt `bookmarks.json` now exits with a readable `aweshelf: ...` message instead of a Python traceback.
- Change: `textual` is now an optional `[tui]` extra — run `pip install 'aweshelf[tui]'` for the `browse` command. Plain installs no longer pull in the TUI dependency tree.
- Refactor: removed the dead `lib/resume.py` shim and deduplicated the resume print/run logic between the `resume` command and `browse`.

## v0.2.0

Beta status, funding support, and aweskill integration.

### Highlights

- Promoted status from alpha to beta
- Added Support section with Ko-fi badge and WeChat funding QR code
- Added `.github/FUNDING.yml` for GitHub Sponsor button
- New: aweskill install option for skill management
- Fix: replaced `we.webioinfo.top` with `www.webioinfo.top`
- Synced Chinese README with English version

## v0.1.9

Self-update command and background update checking.

### Highlights

- Added `aweshelf self-update` command with `--check` flag
- Background update check on each run with 24h cooldown
- Set `AWESHELF_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable

## v0.1.8

Non-interactive bookmarking for agents and scripting.

### Highlights

- `bookmark --no-interactive` — skip all prompts; use defaults or passed values only. Designed for agent and script usage where prompts would block.
- Fix: `bookmark <SESSION_ID>` no longer triggers category prompt when `-c` is not provided (defaults to empty).

## v0.1.7

Better list output and category-as-view model.

Inspired by [PR #2](https://github.com/wehuman01/aweshelf/pull/2) (category management), this release takes a simpler approach: categories are derived from bookmarks, not managed as independent entities. Instead of `category add/list/rm` commands, `aweshelf list --by category` provides the same visibility with zero state to maintain.

### Highlights

- `aweshelf list --by category|provider|profile` — group and count bookmarks by any dimension
- `aweshelf sessions` removes redundant PROJECT column (filtered by current project already)
- `aweshelf sessions -n` help now shows default value (20); output hints when truncated
- `aweshelf list` adds PROJECT column to distinguish cross-project bookmarks

## v0.1.6

Docs refresh and version sync.

### Highlights

- Sync Chinese README with English version
- Update VS Code extension references to aweshelf-extension

## v0.1.4

Code dedup, AI agent docs, and README restructure.

### Highlights

## v0.1.1
